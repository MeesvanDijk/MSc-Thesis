In this folder you can find the code written for my MSc thesis titled: Epeleptic seizure detection using scalp EEG data -  A support tensor machine approach.

## Experiment 1

Experiment 1 first transforms the EEG data into a 3D tensor and then applies SHTM, DuSK and TT-MMK in order to train a model.

## Experiment 2

Experiment 2 first applies a SVD to the EEG data and then applies SHTM and DuSK in order to train a model.

## Experiment 3

Experiment 3 first tesorizes the EEG data into a 3D tensor and then applies SHTM, DuSK and TT-MMK in order to train a model.
